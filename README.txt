Graph visualisation software for siyavula

This is currently a horizontal prototype and will achieve the following:
    1] Parse the data from a .map file
    2] create python objects from the data
    3] output a JSON file called data.json with the necessary node and edge information
    2] Start a server that will render a visualization of the nodes and edges on localhost:8000

To setup the environment to run the software, please ensure that python is installed on your machine and run the following:

sudo sh bootsrap.sh
